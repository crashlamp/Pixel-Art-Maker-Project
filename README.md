# Pixel-Art-Maker-Project
My first project using javaScript
The goal of this project was to write javaScript code that has the user create a grid of custome size and to be able to choose a color and color the cells of the grid by clicking on them.
To use the project, download the files to a folder and open .html file in a web browser
